# What is DP?
    # Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid recomputation.
    # It is usually applied when the problem has:
    # Overlapping subproblems (same subproblems solved multiple times).
    # Optimal substructure (optimal solution can be built from optimal solutions of subproblems).
# ðŸ”¹ Two Approaches in DP
    # Top-Down (Memoization)
        # Solve problem recursively.
        # Store results in a dictionary/array to reuse later.
    # Bottom-Up (Tabulation)
        # Build a table iteratively from smaller subproblems up to the final solution.
    
#Let's understand dp through Fibonacci numbers
