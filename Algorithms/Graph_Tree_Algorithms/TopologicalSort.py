# üîπ Topological Sort
    # üìù What it is
    # A linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
    # Such that for every directed edge u ‚Üí v, u comes before v in the ordering.
    # Example use cases:
    # Task scheduling (if task A must be done before task B).
    # Course prerequisites.
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Works only for DAGs (no cycles and also should not be unDirected).
# üîπ Two Ways to Do It
    # DFS Method
        # Do DFS.
        # After visiting all neighbors, add the node to a stack.
        # Reverse the stack at the end ‚Üí topological order.
    # Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (BFS + Indegree)
        # Count in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node.
        # Start with nodes having 0 in-degree.
        # Remove them and reduce in-degrees of their neighbors.
        # Keep picking nodes with in-degree = 0.
