# Floyd‚ÄìWarshall Algorithm
    # üìù What it does
        # A Dynamic Programming algorithm.->because we store length of path, when required we use them.
        # Finds the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a graph.
        # Works for directed / undirected, positive / negative edges.
        # ‚ö†Ô∏è But does not work if there‚Äôs a negative cycle (like Bellman-Ford).
    # üîπ Idea
        # We keep a distance matrix dist where:
        # dist[i][j] = shortest distance from i to j.
        # Initially:
            # dist[i][j] = weight(i, j) if edge exists,
            # dist[i][j] = 0, if i==j,
            # otherwise ‚àû.
            # Then for each vertex k, check:
            # dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
            # Meaning:
            # ‚ÄúIs it shorter to go from i ‚Üí j directly, or i ‚Üí k ‚Üí j?‚Äù
    #Summary:
        # Dijkstra ‚Üí one source, positive edges.
        # Bellman-Ford ‚Üí one source, negative edges allowed.
        # Floyd-Warshall ‚Üí all pairs shortest paths.
